# This regression analysis consisted of an examination of the correlation between FIFA audience viewership and the nations weighted GDP. We selected a rather simple data set with a strong positive correlation to further explore the languages and highlight the differences between R and Python instead of getting lost in the data and encompassing the wrong narrative. You may also find the data set in the Regression tab. Enjoy!
